# Vocab2JsonLD
This NPM module allows for the conversion of RDF/OWL vocabs to a format which can be read by D3.js.

The input format must be JSON-LD (http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/), I recommend this API for conversion http://rdf-translator.appspot.com/ . 

Only a few have currently been commited to this repo.

The source is well commented, so it should be very easy to understand the code.
